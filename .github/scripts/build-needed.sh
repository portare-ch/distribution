# Does anything in this ref actually affect a build, since the last time we
# built it successfully?
#
# A commit that only touches documentation costs exactly as much CI time as one
# that rewrites the kernel config, because nothing looks. This answers the
# question so an automatic trigger can decline to spend five hours proving that
# a README edit still builds.
#
# It deliberately does NOT gate workflow_dispatch. A human who clicked "Run
# workflow" asked for a build, and silently not producing an image would be a
# worse surprise than a wasted runner. The caller decides; this only reports.
#
# Fails closed in every direction: no previous run, an unreachable API, a
# missing commit, a diff that cannot be taken, or any path it does not
# positively recognise as inert all print "yes".
#
# Prints "yes" or "no". Never exits non-zero.
